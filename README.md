# CAMEL for Retina OCT Image Classification and Segmentation [WACV 2025]

This is the official implementation of "CAMEL: Confidence-Aware Multi-task Ensemble Learning with Spatial Information for Retina OCT Image Classification and Segmentation" accepted in IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV 2025)


## News 
ðŸ”¥October 2024, Paper accepted at WACV 2025 ðŸŽ‰.

## Requirements 
- python 3.10
- torch 2.1.2
- tensorflow 2.9.1
- segmentation-models 1.0.1


## Data Preparation
For training and testing the models, you can use the public dataset [OCT5K](https://rdr.ucl.ac.uk/articles/dataset/OCT5k_A_dataset_of_multi-disease_and_multi-graded_annotations_for_retinal_layers/22128671?file=44436359)

The dataset covers semantic segmentation and object detection tasks.

- "Images": Original OCT Images
- "Masks": pixel-wise annotations with three manual gradings for 1672 images and 2924 masks with single automatic grading
- "Detection": CSV files for object detection labels
